# Here comes all about me... ðŸ‘€

Hi there! I'm Ashley, a current 3rd year college student at Northeastern University where I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Criminal Justice with a minor in Managment Systems Information. My educational journey has been driven by a strong belief in the transformative power of education and that there is no limit on what to learn. My goal is to work in machine learning and computer vision and apply it to law here in the United States. More about me is that I love to hike, cook, and go to the gym.


## Break Through Tech AI
This past semester, I had the privilege of participating in Break Through Tech AI at MIT, a program designed for women and non-binary individuals in Computer Science. As part of the experience, I was selected for a Fall internship with Darshana, Inc., an AI startup based in the Boston area. Darshana is working to address the current recruitment challenges by offering verifiable applicant credential tokens, which help identify ideal candidates for job postings. This innovation not only aims to improve recruitment across industries but also allows clients to retain ownership of their job data.

During my internship, I worked on a project that compared the effectiveness of Darshana's verified applicant entries against unverified ones. Our analysis revealed that the two datasets were too similar to show significant differences in job recommendations. More information is on avaliable on my page.
